# PSO
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is an intelligent optimization algorithm based on the Swarm Intelligence. It is based on a simple mathematical model, developed by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995, to describe the social behavior of birds and fish. The model relies mostly on the basic principles of self-organization which is used to describe the dynamics of complex systems. PSO utilizes a very simplified model of social behavior to solve the optimization problems, in a cooperative and intelligent framework. PSO is one of the most useful and famous metaheuristics and it is successfully applied to various optimization problems.
